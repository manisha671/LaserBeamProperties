# LaserBeamProperties
# Mathematical modeling of LASER keyhole using MATLAB.
Comparing two heat fluxes (front and rear) to corresponding local beam power densities of given LASER. Iterative calculation of keyhole using material constants, given speed, and finding a unique solutions that matches the radius and angles matching the power densities/flux.
